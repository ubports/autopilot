Release Manual Tests
====================

Not all our tests are automated at the moment. Specifically, the vis tool is lacking some automated tests due to deficiancies in other packages. Until we remedy this situation, the following things need to be manually tested upon an autopilot release:

- Run the following tests by running both: ``autopilot vis`` and ``autopilot3 vis``.
 - Run 'window-mocker -testability' and the vis tool. 
  - Make sure you can select window-mocker from the connection list.
  - Make sure the top-level tree node is 'window-mocker'
 - Run the vis tool with the '-testability' flag enabled. Run a second vis tool, and make sure that the second vis tool can introspect the first.
 - Make sure that the component overlay feature highlights the selected item in the tree view, as long as it has a globalRect.
 - Make sure that searching works:
  - Searching narrows down tree view to just the nodes that match the search criteria.
  - Searching turns off the current component overlay (if any).
  - Resetting the search restores the tree view to the full tree.
  - Resetting the search turns off the current component overlay (if any).
